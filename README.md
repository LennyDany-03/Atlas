ATLAS is an AI Agent built for automation-first intelligence.
Unlike traditional chatbots, ATLAS is designed to do things — open apps, control systems, automate workflows, interact with APIs, and execute multi-step tasks based on natural language instructions.

ATLAS follows a simple but powerful principle:
Intent → Plan → Execute → Learn

The goal is to build a reliable, system-level AI agent that can automate anything repeatable, while remaining transparent, controllable, and safe.
